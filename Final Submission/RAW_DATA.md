# RAW_DATA
### Aquirering the data
I downloaded the data provided by Ananth R. on Kaggle. Weather Prediction
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ananthr1/weather-prediction

### Data contained within the project repository
While I originally had a .gitignore, it became obsolete once I changed my project as my project no longer had as much data. For that reason, my csv is in my repository: https://github.com/44-566-Machine-Learning-S24/ml-s24-project-CarterPlenge/blob/master/seattle-weather.csv

### Data Features
#### All columns 
date, precipitation, temp_max, temp_min, wind, and weather. 
#### Features
precipitation, temp_max, temp_min, and wind
#### Target Variable
Weather
### Getting the data
No additional resources were used to get my data. I simply downloaded it from Kaggle.
