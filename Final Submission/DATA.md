# DATA
My data had a very uneven distribution of data points with almost all of the records either being rainy or drizzly as can be seen in the histogram below.

When clustering the data, the algorithm seemed to split the data set in half based on temp Max, then include all of the data points with high precipitation in a different cluster.
