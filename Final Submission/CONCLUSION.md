# Conclusion
### Model preformance
A monjority of the models i made struggled with the distribution of data often failing to predict fog, snow, and drizzle. The most effective model i was able to create was a neural net with scores around .85. However, if you drop the features for fog and drizzle, the preformance imporved to scores around .95. 
### Challenges encountered
The biggest changlenge I faced was the models not even trying to predict fog, snow, and drizzle. This is largely due ot the imbalanced dataset.
### Future Directions
For future directions i think it would be benifficial to look for more ways to differenciate fog and drizzle.
