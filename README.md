# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict whether it will rain, snow, fog, or will be sunny on a given day. It makes its predictions based on air conditions such as temperature and precipitation.

### What I learned
One of the biggest things I have learned is that machine learning is not just stuffing a bunch of data into a model and expecting good results. A lot of machine learning is tinkering with your data and finding ways to manipulate it inorder to increase the performance of the model. In addition to this, I learned more about each model. Linear regression seems pointless if your data isn't all in all linear, SVM and decision trees are great but don't seem to do well with extreme data imbalances, and Neural nets are great but difficult to understand how it makes predictions. Along with that, I found that trying to get these models to predict a small set of instances (drizzle) wedged in between and around two large sets of instances (sunny and rainy) is extremely difficult.
