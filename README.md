Project Change.
I changed my project from predicting tesela accidnets with weather to predicing crime rates with wether. I did this because I was struggleing to find suffectent data for the teselas. 

In the initial_exploration notebook i found correlations between the weather attribues but there didnt appear to be any visable corelation between weather conditions and crime rate. I only found a corelation after I started using linear regression. 

I managed to get the linear regression model down to a ~.09 mean squared error value. compared to the unpredictive model that could get a ~.22 mean squared error value. So while i didnt find any strong corelations at first because the model was able to predict crime rates with relative accruacy I belive there is a corelation between the weather conditions of a day and the number of crimes commited that day.
